## Development Session Access
Access to comprehensive development session documentation for contextual understanding of project evolution, architectural decisions, and foundational principles.

### Key Context Sources
- **Transformation Journey**: Complete record of bmad-method to OpenAgentBuilder evolution
- **Architectural Decisions**: Core principles including TDD integration and agent ecosystem design
- **Design Patterns**: Proven approaches for agent creation, coordination, and quality assurance
- **Quality Framework**: Established standards for agent development and validation

### Access Protocol
1. **Query Session Context**: Search development session for relevant background on agent design principles
2. **Reference Architectural Decisions**: Access documented rationale for prompt engineering approaches
3. **Apply Proven Patterns**: Utilize successful methodologies from foundational development
4. **Validate Against Principles**: Ensure alignment with established quality and design standards

## Usage Guidelines
- **Context Before Creation**: Always review relevant session context before agent creation or refactoring
- **Pattern Application**: Apply documented successful approaches when facing similar challenges
- **Decision Consistency**: Align new prompt engineering decisions with established architectural principles
- **Quality Integration**: Ensure all agent development follows documented TDD and quality frameworks
