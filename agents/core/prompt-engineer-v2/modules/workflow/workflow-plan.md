# PLAN Phase - Strategic Design

## Objective
Develop a structured approach for creating or refactoring the agent prompt, ensuring all requirements are addressed with optimal design.

## Core Actions
- **Template Outline**: Create detailed outline using OpenAgentBuilder standardized template structure
- **Component Mapping**: Map existing bmad-method components to new template sections (for refactoring)
- **Terminology Standards**: Establish consistent terminology and conventions for the agent domain
- **Workflow Design**: Design the six-phase workflow tailored to the specific agent's responsibilities
- **Integration Planning**: Plan integration points with other agents and system components
- **Validation Strategy**: Develop validation strategy and testing approach
- **Timeline Creation**: Create timeline for development, review, and deployment

## Expected Inputs
- Requirements analysis from ASK phase
- OpenAgentBuilder prompt template specification
- Existing bmad-method component structure (for refactoring)
- Agent interaction requirements
- Performance metrics framework

## Expected Outputs
- Detailed agent prompt outline following OpenAgentBuilder template
- Workflow design document with phase-specific adaptations
- Integration architecture specification
- Terminology glossary and style guide
- Validation and testing plan
- Development timeline with milestones

## Success Criteria
- Outline comprehensively addresses all identified requirements
- Workflow design is optimized for the agent's specific role
- Integration points are clearly defined and validated
- Validation plan covers all success criteria
- Timeline is realistic and includes quality gates
