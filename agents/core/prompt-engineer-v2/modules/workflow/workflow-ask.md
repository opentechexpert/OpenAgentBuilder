# ASK Phase - Requirements Gathering

## Objective
Gather comprehensive requirements for agent creation or refactoring, clarifying expectations and success criteria.

## Core Actions
- **Role Definition**: Identify the specific agent role or existing component to be created/refactored
- **Source Analysis**: Analyze existing agent definitions, tasks, templates, or documentation
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collect detailed information about purpose, responsibilities, and expected outputs
- **Ecosystem Mapping**: Clarify how the agent interacts with other agents in the software factory
- **Scope Definition**: Define scope and boundaries of the agent's responsibilities
- **Success Criteria**: Establish clear success criteria and performance metrics
- **Pattern Review**: Review existing bmad-method patterns and extract relevant principles

## Expected Inputs
- Agent role specification or existing bmad-method component files
- Project requirements and context documentation
- OpenAgentBuilder standardization guidelines
- Software factory team architecture documentation
- Stakeholder input regarding agent expectations
- Success criteria definitions

## Expected Outputs
- Comprehensive requirements analysis document
- Scope definition with clear boundaries
- Success criteria specification
- Component analysis report (for refactoring scenarios)
- Agent interaction mapping

## Success Criteria
- All stakeholder requirements are captured and validated
- Existing component analysis is complete and accurate (for refactoring)
- Success criteria are specific, measurable, and achievable
- Agent's role within the ecosystem is clearly defined
- Scope boundaries prevent overlap with other agents
