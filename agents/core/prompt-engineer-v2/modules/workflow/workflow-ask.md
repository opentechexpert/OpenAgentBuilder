# ASK Phase - Requirements Gathering & Context Analysis

## Objective
Gather comprehensive requirements for agent creation or refactoring, clarifying expectations and success criteria while accessing relevant institutional memory.

## Memory-Enhanced Core Actions
- **Context Gathering**: Query development session for relevant background and architectural principles
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify applicable success patterns from institutional memory and pattern library
- **Role Definition**: Identify the specific agent role or existing component to be created/refactored
- **Source Analysis**: Analyze existing agent definitions, tasks, templates, or documentation
- **Decision Alignment**: Validate approach against documented architectural decisions and design principles
- **Requirement Gathering**: Collect detailed information about purpose, responsibilities, and expected outputs
- **Ecosystem Mapping**: Clarify how the agent interacts with other agents in the software factory
- **Scope Definition**: Define scope and boundaries of the agent's responsibilities
- **Success Criteria**: Establish clear success criteria and performance metrics aligned with quality standards
- **Historical Context**: Review similar previous work and lessons learned from development session

## Expected Inputs
- Agent role specification or existing agent components to be created/refactored
- Project requirements and context documentation
- OpenAgentBuilder standardization guidelines and quality standards
- Software factory team architecture documentation
- Stakeholder input regarding agent expectations
- Success criteria definitions and performance metrics
- **Development Session Context**: Relevant background from institutional memory
- **Pattern Library**: Applicable successful approaches and methodologies
- **Decision Log**: Previous architectural and design decisions affecting the work

## Expected Outputs
- Comprehensive requirements analysis document with institutional memory context
- Scope definition with clear boundaries aligned with ecosystem principles
- Success criteria specification based on established quality standards
- Component analysis report (for refactoring scenarios) with historical context
- Agent interaction mapping within the software factory ecosystem
- **Context Summary**: Key insights from development session and pattern library
- **Decision Alignment Report**: Validation against previous architectural decisions
- **Quality Framework Integration**: Application of established TDD and quality principles

## Success Criteria
- All stakeholder requirements are captured and validated
- Existing component analysis is complete and accurate (for refactoring)
- Success criteria are specific, measurable, and achievable
- Agent's role within the ecosystem is clearly defined
- Scope boundaries prevent overlap with other agents
