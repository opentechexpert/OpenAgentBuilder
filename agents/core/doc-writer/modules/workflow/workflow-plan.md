# PLAN - Documentation Strategy Workflow

## Objective
Design comprehensive documentation architecture and establish strategic framework for content creation and maintenance.

## Process Overview
The PLAN phase transforms requirements from the ASK phase into a concrete, actionable documentation strategy with clear architecture, processes, and standards.

## Actions Framework

### 1. Information Architecture Design

- **Cross-Reference Strategy**: Plan linking strategy and relationship mapping between content
- **Search Strategy**: Design search functionality and content discoverability approach
- **Content Lifecycle Management**: Plan content creation, maintenance, and retirement processes

**Architecture Components**:
```
Information Architecture Framework:
├── Content Categories
│   ├── Getting Started
│   ├── User Guides
│   ├── Technical Reference
│   ├── Tutorials
│   └── Community Resources
├── Navigation Hierarchy
│   ├── Primary Navigation
│   ├── Secondary Navigation
│   ├── Contextual Navigation
│   └── Utility Navigation
└── Content Relationships
    ├── Parent-Child Relationships
    ├── Cross-References
    ├── Related Content
    └── Progressive Disclosure
```

### 2. Style Guide and Standards Development
**Style Standards**:
- **Writing Style Guidelines**: Tone, voice, and language standards for all content
- **Formatting Standards**: Markdown syntax, heading structure, and visual formatting rules
- **Terminology Management**: Glossary development and consistent terminology usage
- **Code Documentation Standards**: Standards for code examples, inline comments, and technical reference
- **Visual Design Guidelines**: Image standards, diagram conventions, and visual consistency rules

**Style Guide Components**:
```markdown
# Style Guide Framework

## Writing Standards

```

### 3. Content Workflow and Review Process Design
**Workflow Design**:
- **Content Creation Workflow**: Step-by-step process from conception to publication
- **Review and Approval Process**: Multi-stage review process with clear responsibilities
- **Quality Assurance Integration**: QA checkpoints and validation procedures
- **Community Contribution Process**: Framework for community contributions and collaboration
- **Update and Maintenance Workflow**: Process for keeping content current and accurate

**Workflow Framework**:
```
Content Creation Pipeline:
1. Content Planning → Requirements Review → Approval to Proceed
2. Research and Draft → SME Review → Technical Validation
3. Internal Review → Quality Assurance → Stakeholder Approval
4. Community Review → Final Validation → Publication
5. Analytics Review → Feedback Integration → Continuous Improvement
```

### 4. Template Structure and Component Design
**Template Development**:
- **Content Type Templates**: Standardized templates for each type of documentation
- **Reusable Components**: Modular components for consistent content elements
- **Layout Standards**: Page layout and structure standards for different content types
- **Interactive Elements**: Templates for interactive tutorials and guided experiences
- **Accessibility Templates**: Ensure all templates meet accessibility standards

**Template Library**:
```
Template Categories:
├── API Documentation Templates
├── Tutorial Templates
├── Getting Started Templates
├── Troubleshooting Templates
├── Reference Documentation Templates
└── Community Contribution Templates

Component Library:
├── Code Example Components
├── Callout and Alert Components
├── Navigation Components
├── Interactive Elements
└── Accessibility Components
```

### 5. Integration and Tool Strategy
**Platform Integration**:
- **Documentation Platform Selection**: Choose and configure documentation hosting platform
- **Tool Integration Strategy**: Integration with development tools, version control, and CI/CD
- **Analytics and Monitoring**: Setup for performance monitoring and user behavior tracking
- **Search and Discovery**: Implementation of search functionality and content discovery tools
- **Community Platform Integration**: Integration with community forums, feedback systems, and contribution platforms

## Deliverables

### 1. Documentation Strategy Document
**Strategy Framework**:
```markdown
# Documentation Strategy Document

## Vision and Objectives
- Documentation vision and mission
- Strategic objectives and goals
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Resource requirements and allocation

## Information Architecture
- Content taxonomy and organization
- Navigation structure and hierarchy

### 4. Content Creation Timeline
**Project Planning**:
```
Timeline Framework:
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Core documentation setup
- Template implementation
- Initial content creation

Phase 2: Content Development (Weeks 3-8)
- Primary content creation
- Review and validation cycles
- Community integration setup

Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 9-12)
