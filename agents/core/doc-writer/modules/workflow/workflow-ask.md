# ASK - Requirements Gathering Workflow

## Objective
Understand documentation needs and scope through comprehensive stakeholder engagement and requirements analysis.

## Process Overview
The ASK phase establishes the foundation for all documentation efforts by ensuring complete understanding of requirements, audience needs, and success criteria.

## Actions Framework

### 1. Stakeholder Engagement
**Primary Activities**:
- **Interview Key Stakeholders**: Conduct structured interviews with project owners, developers, and end users
- **Subject Matter Expert Consultation**: Engage technical experts to understand complex topics and requirements
- **User Persona Development**: Create detailed user personas based on actual user research and feedback
- **Cross-Functional Alignment**: Ensure alignment between technical, business, and user requirements
- **Expectation Management**: Establish clear expectations for deliverables, timelines, and quality standards

**Interview Framework**:
```
1. Current State Assessment
   - What documentation currently exists?
   - What are the current pain points?
   - What gaps need to be addressed?

2. Requirements Definition
   - What specific outcomes are needed?
   - Who are the primary and secondary audiences?
   - What are the technical constraints?

3. Success Criteria
   - How will success be measured?
   - What are the key performance indicators?
   - What constitutes quality documentation?
```

### 2. Gap Analysis and Opportunity Assessment
**Analysis Activities**:
- **Existing Documentation Audit**: Comprehensive review of current documentation state
- **Competitive Analysis**: Review of documentation best practices in similar projects
- **Technology Landscape Assessment**: Understanding of current and planned technology stack
- **Community Needs Assessment**: Analysis of community feedback and contribution patterns
- **Accessibility Gap Analysis**: Identification of accessibility and inclusion opportunities

**Documentation Inventory**:
- Content audit checklist
- Quality assessment framework
- Gap identification matrix
- Priority ranking system
- Opportunity assessment report

### 3. Audience Analysis and Use Case Definition
**User Research Activities**:
- **Target Audience Segmentation**: Clear definition of primary, secondary, and tertiary audiences
- **Use Case Mapping**: Comprehensive mapping of all user journeys and scenarios
- **Skill Level Assessment**: Understanding of audience technical competency and knowledge gaps
- **Context Analysis**: Understanding of where and how documentation will be used
- **Device and Platform Considerations**: Analysis of how users will access documentation

**Deliverable Framework**:
```
Audience Segments:
- Developers (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- System Administrators
- Community Contributors
- End Users
- Decision Makers

Use Cases:
- Initial Setup and Configuration
- Daily Operations and Maintenance
- Troubleshooting and Problem Resolution
- Advanced Customization and Extension
- Community Contribution and Collaboration
```

### 4. Technical Requirements and Constraints
**Technical Analysis**:
- **Platform Requirements**: Understanding of hosting, delivery, and technical platforms
- **Integration Needs**: Requirements for integration with existing systems and workflows
- **Performance Requirements**: Loading speed, search functionality, and scalability needs
- **Security Considerations**: Data protection, access control, and compliance requirements
- **Accessibility Standards**: WCAG compliance and inclusive design requirements

**Constraint Documentation**:
- Budget and resource limitations
- Timeline and delivery requirements
- Technology stack constraints
- Compliance and regulatory requirements
- Maintenance and update capabilities

## Deliverables

### 1. Documentation Requirements Specification
**Content Requirements**:
```markdown
# Documentation Requirements Specification

## Project Overview

- Use case scenarios

## Content Requirements
- Required documentation types
- Depth and breadth of coverage
- Format and delivery requirements
- Integration and cross-reference needs

## Quality Standards
- Accuracy requirements
- Accessibility standards
- Performance criteria
- Maintenance expectations
```

### 2. Audience Analysis Report
**Research Findings**:
- User persona documentation
- Journey mapping results
- Pain point identification
- Opportunity assessment
- Recommendation summary

### 3. Content Scope and Timeline
**Project Planning**:
- Comprehensive content inventory
- Priority matrix and phasing plan
- Resource allocation requirements
- Timeline with dependencies
- Risk assessment and mitigation

### 4. Quality Standards Checklist
**Quality Framework**:
- Technical accuracy requirements
- Accessibility compliance standards
- User experience criteria
- Performance benchmarks
- Maintenance and update protocols

## Success Metrics

### Completion Criteria
- [ ] All stakeholders interviewed and requirements documented
- [ ] Comprehensive audience analysis completed
- [ ] Technical requirements and constraints identified
- [ ] Quality standards and success criteria established
- [ ] Project scope and timeline approved by stakeholders

### Quality Indicators
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: 100% stakeholder agreement on requirements
- **Requirement Completeness**: All critical requirements documented and validated
- **Audience Understanding**: Detailed user personas and use cases defined
- **Feasibility Confirmation**: Technical and resource feasibility validated
- **Success Metrics Defined**: Clear, measurable success criteria established

## Next Phase Integration
The ASK phase outputs directly inform the PLAN phase activities:
- Requirements specification guides information architecture design
- Audience analysis drives content strategy and structure decisions
- Technical constraints inform platform and tool selection
- Quality standards establish validation and testing frameworks
- Timeline requirements shape project planning and resource allocation
