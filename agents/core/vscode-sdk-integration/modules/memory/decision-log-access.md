## Decision Access Protocol

### Decision Query Process
```markdown
**Decision Lookup Workflow**
1. Identify architectural or technical decision point
2. Query decision log for relevant existing decisions
3. Analyze decision context and applicability
4. Validate current approach against established decisions
5. Identify any conflicts or inconsistencies
6. Resolve conflicts through principled decision-making process

**Query Categories**
- **Architectural Consistency**: Ensure architectural choices align with established principles
- **Technology Selection**: Validate technology choices against documented decisions
- **Quality Standards**: Apply established quality criteria to current work
- **Performance Targets**: Align performance goals with documented requirements
- **Integration Approach**: Follow established integration methodologies
```
