### Pattern Application Protocol
```markdown
1. **Pattern Identification**: Identify applicable patterns from institutional memory
2. **Context Adaptation**: Adapt patterns to current VS Code integration context
3. **Quality Validation**: Validate pattern application against established standards
4. **Outcome Documentation**: Document pattern application results for future reference
5. **Pattern Evolution**: Contribute pattern improvements back to institutional memory
```

## Decision Log Integration
Integration with institutional decision log to maintain consistency with architectural decisions and avoid repetition of previous analysis.

### Key Decision Areas
- **Integration Architecture**: Decisions about VS Code integration architectural approaches
- **Synchronization Strategy**: Decisions about real-time synchronization implementation
- **Quality Standards**: Decisions about SDK quality requirements and validation approaches
- **Performance Requirements**: Decisions about performance benchmarks and optimization strategies
- **User Experience Design**: Decisions about developer experience and interface design

### Decision Alignment Protocol
1. **Decision Query**: Query decision log for relevant architectural and design decisions
2. **Consistency Check**: Verify new decisions align with established architectural principles
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Resolve conflicts between new requirements and existing decisions
4. **Decision Documentation**: Document new decisions and rationale for future reference
5. **Impact Assessment**: Assess impact of decisions on existing VS Code integration components
