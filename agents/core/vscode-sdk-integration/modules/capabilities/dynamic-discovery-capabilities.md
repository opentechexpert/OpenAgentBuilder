# Dynamic Agent Discovery Capabilities

## Overview
This module enables the VS Code SDK Integration Agent to automatically discover new agents, detect changes in existing agents, and maintain an up-to-date registry of available OpenAgentBuilder agents for VS Code integration.

## Core Discovery Features

### Filesystem Monitoring
- **Agent Directory Scanning**: Continuously monitor `/agents/` directory structure for new agent additions
- **Change Detection**: Detect modifications to existing agent files using file system watchers
- **Metadata Extraction**: Parse agent identity sections to extract version, role, and capabilities
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify agent dependencies and cross-references automatically
- **Structure Validation**: Ensure discovered agents conform to OpenAgentBuilder standards

### Agent Registry Management
- **Central Registry**: Maintain a comprehensive registry of all discovered agents
- **Version Tracking**: Track agent versions and detect updates requiring synchronization
- **Status Monitoring**: Monitor agent health and integration compatibility
- **Categorization**: Automatically categorize agents by type (core, development, management, specialized)
- **Priority Assessment**: Determine integration priority based on agent metadata and usage patterns

### Memory-Enhanced Discovery
- **Pattern Recognition**: Use institutional memory to identify agent patterns and predict integration requirements
- **Decision Context**: Query development session history for context on agent evolution
- **Quality Assessment**: Apply established quality standards to evaluate newly discovered agents
- **Integration Readiness**: Assess agent readiness for VS Code integration based on documented criteria

## Discovery Protocols

### Initialization Discovery
```bash
# Scan all agent directories for initial registry creation
discover_agents() {
    scan_directory("/agents/core/")
    scan_directory("/agents/development/")
    scan_directory("/agents/management/")
    scan_directory("/agents/specialized/")
    
    validate_agent_structure()
    extract_metadata()
    build_registry()
    assess_integration_priority()
}
```

### Continuous Monitoring
- **File System Watchers**: Monitor agent directories for real-time changes
- **Scheduled Scans**: Periodic full scans to catch any missed changes
- **Event Processing**: Process discovery events through memory-enhanced workflow
- **Registry Updates**: Maintain registry consistency with discovered changes
- **Notification System**: Alert other systems of discovered changes requiring action

### Change Event Processing
```markdown
**New Agent Detected**
1. Extract agent metadata and structure
2. Query memory for similar agent patterns
3. Assess integration complexity and requirements
4. Queue for VS Code prompt file generation
5. Update registry with new agent information

**Agent Modified**
1. Compare with previous version in registry
2. Identify specific changes and impact scope
3. Determine if VS Code integration update required
4. Queue appropriate synchronization tasks
5. Update registry with new version information

**Agent Removed**
1. Identify affected VS Code integrations
2. Plan graceful deprecation strategy
3. Update documentation and user guidance
4. Remove from registry and clean up artifacts
```
