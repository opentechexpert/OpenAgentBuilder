# Create SDK Task

## Task Overview
**Task Name**: Create VS Code SDK  
**Category**: Core Implementation  
**Priority**: Critical  
**Estimated Duration**: 8-12 hours  

## Objective
Design and implement the complete VS Code SDK structure for OpenAgentBuilder integration, including folder organization, automation scripts, documentation, and validation procedures.

## Prerequisites
- OpenAgentBuilder agent library analysis completed
- VS Code integration requirements documented
- SDK architecture design approved
- Development environment configured

## Task Steps

### 1. Setup SDK Structure
- [ ] Create `/integrations/vscode/` root directory
- [ ] Establish folder hierarchy (agents/, instructions/, tools/, docs/)
- [ ] Create initial configuration files (.vscode/settings.json, .vscode/extensions.json)
- [ ] Setup README.md and CONFIGURATION.md files

### 2. Implement Conversion System
- [ ] Develop agent-to-prompt conversion logic
- [ ] Create prompt file templates for different agent types
- [ ] Implement cross-reference management system
- [ ] Build validation rules for converted files

### 3. Create Automation Tools
- [ ] Develop sync-agents.js synchronization script
- [ ] Create validate-prompts.js validation tool
- [ ] Build setup-workspace.js configuration automation
- [ ] Implement error handling and logging

### 4. Generate Initial Prompt Files
- [ ] Convert core agents (prompt-engineer-v2, doc-writer, orchestrator)
- [ ] Convert development agents (master-software-engineer, frontend-engineer, backend-engineer)
- [ ] Convert management agents (product-owner, project-manager, scrum-master)
- [ ] Validate all converted prompt files

### 5. Create Documentation
- [ ] Write comprehensive setup guide
- [ ] Create usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Develop troubleshooting documentation
- [ ] Generate API reference documentation

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Complete SDK folder structure implemented
- [ ] All priority agents successfully converted to prompt files
- [ ] Automation scripts function correctly with error handling
- [ ] Documentation enables easy setup and adoption
- [ ] All prompt files validated and tested in VS Code
- [ ] Performance requirements met (loading time < 2s)

## Deliverables
- **SDK Structure**: Complete `/integrations/vscode/` folder with all components
- **Prompt Files**: Converted .prompt.md files for all priority agents
- **Automation Scripts**: Working synchronization and validation tools
- **Documentation Package**: Setup guides, usage examples, troubleshooting
- **Configuration Files**: VS Code workspace and extension configurations
- **Validation Report**: Comprehensive testing and quality validation results

## Dependencies
- OpenAgentBuilder agent library access
- VS Code development environment
- Node.js for automation scripts
- Git repository access for version control

## Risk Mitigation
- **Conversion Accuracy**: Implement comprehensive validation to ensure content integrity
- **Performance Issues**: Performance testing and optimization throughout development
- **VS Code Compatibility**: Test across different VS Code versions and configurations
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Design for minimal ongoing maintenance requirements

## Success Metrics
- All target agents converted successfully (100%)
- Setup success rate for new users (>95%)
- Prompt file loading performance (<2 seconds)
- User satisfaction with initial release (>4.0/5)

## Follow-up Tasks
- [ ] User testing and feedback collection
- [ ] Performance optimization based on usage patterns
- [ ] Community documentation and adoption support
- [ ] Ongoing synchronization and maintenance procedures
