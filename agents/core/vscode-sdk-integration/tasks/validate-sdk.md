# Validate SDK Task

## Task Overview
**Task Name**: Validate VS Code SDK  
**Category**: Quality Assurance  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Duration**: 4-6 hours  

## Objective
Comprehensively validate the VS Code SDK implementation to ensure all components function correctly, meet quality standards, and provide a reliable user experience.

## Prerequisites
- VS Code SDK implementation completed
- All prompt files generated and available
- Automation scripts implemented
- Documentation created
- VS Code test environment configured

## Validation Scope

### 1. Functional Validation
- [ ] **Prompt File Functionality**: Test all .prompt.md files in VS Code
- [ ] **Agent Behavior**: Verify agent responses match expected behavior
- [ ] **Cross-References**: Validate all links to source agents
- [ ] **Variable Substitution**: Test VS Code variable functionality (${workspaceFolder}, ${selection}, etc.)
- [ ] **Tool Integration**: Verify codebase, githubRepo, and terminal tools work correctly

### 2. Technical Validation
- [ ] **File Format Compliance**: Ensure all prompt files follow VS Code specifications
- [ ] **Metadata Accuracy**: Validate mode, tools, and description settings
- [ ] **Folder Structure**: Verify SDK folder organization matches specification
- [ ] **Configuration Files**: Test .vscode/settings.json and extensions.json
- [ ] **Automation Scripts**: Validate sync, validation, and setup tools

### 3. Performance Validation
- [ ] **Loading Performance**: Measure prompt file loading times
- [ ] **Response Performance**: Test agent response initiation times
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: Monitor SDK memory footprint
- [ ] **Startup Impact**: Measure VS Code startup time impact
- [ ] **Scalability**: Test with large workspaces and multiple agents

### 4. Integration Validation
- [ ] **VS Code Compatibility**: Test across VS Code versions (1.80+)
- [ ] **Extension Compatibility**: Verify compatibility with common extensions
- [ ] **Platform Compatibility**: Test on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- [ ] **GitHub Copilot Integration**: Ensure seamless Copilot compatibility
- [ ] **Workspace Configuration**: Validate workspace-specific settings

### 5. User Experience Validation
- [ ] **Setup Process**: Test SDK setup from scratch
- [ ] **Documentation Clarity**: Validate setup and usage documentation
- [ ] **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] **User Workflow**: Validate common developer workflows
- [ ] **Team Sharing**: Test team-wide configuration sharing

## Validation Procedures

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run validation scripts
npm run validate-sdk
npm run test-prompts
npm run performance-test

# Sync validation
npm run sync-test
npm run integrity-check
```

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Open VS Code with SDK configured
- [ ] Test each agent prompt file individually
- [ ] Verify agent responses are appropriate and helpful
- [ ] Test variable substitution in different contexts
- [ ] Validate cross-references open correctly
- [ ] Test in different workspace configurations

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure prompt loading times across all agents
- [ ] Test with large codebases (>10k files)
- [ ] Monitor memory usage during extended sessions
- [ ] Test concurrent usage of multiple agents
- [ ] Validate performance on different hardware configurations

## Test Scenarios

### Core Agent Testing
**Prompt Engineer V2**: Test prompt optimization and agent creation workflows
**Doc Writer**: Test documentation generation and technical writing
**Orchestrator**: Test multi-agent coordination and workflow management

### Development Agent Testing
**Master Software Engineer**: Test complex development task handling
**Frontend Engineer**: Test React/frontend specific functionality
**Backend Engineer**: Test API and server-side development tasks

### Workflow Testing
**Code Analysis**: Test codebase tool integration
**GitHub Integration**: Test githubRepo tool functionality
**Terminal Integration**: Test terminalLastCommand tool usage

## Quality Gates

### Critical Requirements
- [ ] All prompt files load successfully (100%)
- [ ] Agent responses are contextually appropriate (>95%)
- [ ] Cross-references work correctly (100%)
- [ ] Performance meets targets (<2s loading, <1s response)
- [ ] No critical errors or failures

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Prompt loading time < 2 seconds
- [ ] Agent response initiation < 1 second
- [ ] Memory usage < 50MB additional overhead
- [ ] VS Code startup impact < 500ms
- [ ] Sync operations complete < 30 seconds

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Setup process completable in < 15 minutes
- [ ] Documentation is clear and comprehensive
- [ ] Error messages are helpful and actionable
- [ ] Workflow integration feels natural
- [ ] Team sharing works seamlessly

## Issue Resolution Process

### Issue Classification
**Critical**: Prevents basic functionality or causes data loss
**High**: Significantly impacts user experience or performance
**Medium**: Minor functionality issues or cosmetic problems
**Low**: Enhancement requests or minor documentation issues

### Resolution Workflow
1. **Issue Identification**: Document issue with reproduction steps
2. **Impact Assessment**: Classify severity and user impact
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify underlying cause
4. **Solution Implementation**: Develop and test fix
5. **Validation**: Verify fix resolves issue without regression
6. **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation
