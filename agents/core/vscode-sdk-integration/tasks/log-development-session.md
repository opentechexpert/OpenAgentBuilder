# Log Development Session Task

## Task Overview
**Task Name**: Log Development Session  
**Agent**: VS Code SDK Integration  
**Category**: Documentation & Quality Assurance  
**Priority**: Required  
**Estimated Duration**: 15-30 minutes  
**Frequency**: After every significant development session

## Objective
Document development sessions following OpenAgentBuilder standards to ensure institutional memory capture, quality tracking, and collaborative development support for VS Code SDK Integration agent activities.

## Prerequisites
- Development session completed
- SDK integration changes implemented and tested
- Quality validation performed
- Understanding of OpenAgentBuilder logging standards

## Task Steps

### 1. Session Information Gathering
- [ ] Generate session ID using format: `VSCODE-SDK-{SESSION-TYPE}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH}`
- [ ] Identify session type (CRE/VAL/REF/ENH/ANA/FIX/INT)
- [ ] Document session duration and participants
- [ ] Determine session status (COMPLETED/IN_PROGRESS/BLOCKED/REVIEW_NEEDED)

### 2. Create Development Session Log
**Location**: `/docs/internal/knowledge-base/development-sessions/`

- [ ] Create new session file with standardized session ID format
- [ ] Document complete session information and context
- [ ] Record methodology applied (six-phase workflow, quality standards, etc.)
- [ ] List all changes made (files, versions, configurations)
- [ ] Record key findings and quality assessments
- [ ] Include recommendations for future work
- [ ] Add cross-references to related sessions and files

### 3. Update Knowledge Base Integration
**Location**: `/docs/internal/knowledge-base/development-patterns/`

- [ ] Identify reusable patterns from session
- [ ] Document new methodologies or approaches
- [ ] Update existing pattern documentation
- [ ] Create new pattern files if needed
- [ ] Link patterns to session for reference

### 4. Version Management
- [ ] Update agent version if significant changes made
- [ ] Document version increment rationale
- [ ] Ensure version consistency across all references

### 5. Quality Validation
- [ ] Apply relevant OpenAgentBuilder quality checklists
- [ ] Document compliance status and scores
- [ ] Note any standards improvements identified

## Expected Outputs
- Complete development session log in centralized knowledge base
- Updated knowledge patterns (if applicable)
- Version updates (if significant changes made)
- Quality validation results

## Success Criteria
- Session log follows OpenAgentBuilder standards
- All changes and findings documented
- Knowledge patterns extracted and documented
- Cross-references maintained
- Institutional memory preserved

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Session ID follows standard format
- [ ] All required sections completed
- [ ] Changes documented with file references
- [ ] Key findings clearly articulated
- [ ] Recommendations actionable and prioritized
- [ ] Cross-references accurate and complete
- [ ] Knowledge patterns identified and documented
