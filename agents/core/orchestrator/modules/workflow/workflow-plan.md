# Workflow Phase: PLAN - Orchestration Strategy

## Objective
Design optimal multi-agent workflow coordination strategy based on comprehensive analysis from the OBSERVE phase, ensuring efficient resource utilization and successful outcome achievement.

## Core Activities

### Workflow Architecture Design
Systematic approach to coordination structure:
- **Task Decomposition**: Breaking complex workflows into manageable, discrete tasks
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identifying task relationships and prerequisite sequences
- **Agent Assignment Matrix**: Optimal matching of tasks to agent capabilities
- **Resource Allocation Plan**: Distribution of computational, time, and human resources
- **Timeline Development**: Realistic scheduling with buffer time for quality assurance

### Coordination Strategy Development
Framework for multi-agent collaboration:
- **Communication Protocols**: Standardized interaction patterns between agents
- **Handoff Procedures**: Seamless transitions between workflow stages
- **Synchronization Points**: Coordination moments for parallel workflow streams
- **Decision Points**: Key moments requiring orchestrator intervention or approval
- **Escalation Procedures**: Clear protocols for handling issues and conflicts

### Quality Assurance Planning
Integration of TDD principles and quality standards:
- **Quality Gates**: Mandatory checkpoints ensuring standards compliance
- **Testing Strategy**: Comprehensive validation approach for all deliverables
- **Validation Criteria**: Specific, measurable success indicators
- **Review Processes**: Structured evaluation and approval procedures
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time quality assessment throughout execution

### Risk Mitigation Strategy
Proactive approach to identified challenges:
- **Contingency Planning**: Alternative approaches for high-risk scenarios
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Backup plans for critical workflow components
- **Resource Buffering**: Additional capacity allocation for unexpected needs
- **Monitoring Systems**: Early warning indicators for potential issues
- **Recovery Procedures**: Systematic approaches to handling failures

## Planning Framework

### Strategic Planning
High-level coordination approach:
- **Workflow Pattern Selection**: Choosing optimal coordination methodology
- **Success Metrics Definition**: Quantifiable indicators of achievement
- **Stakeholder Communication Plan**: Regular updates and feedback mechanisms
- **Integration Points**: Coordination with broader system and external dependencies
- **Innovation Opportunities**: Areas for process improvement and optimization

### Tactical Planning
Detailed execution methodology:
- **Task Sequencing**: Optimal ordering of workflow components
- **Resource Scheduling**: Time-based allocation of agents and resources
- **Communication Schedule**: Regular coordination and status update intervals
- **Quality Checkpoints**: Specific timing and criteria for validation gates
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time tracking mechanisms and reporting procedures

### Operational Planning
Day-to-day execution details:
- **Task Assignments**: Specific agent responsibilities and deliverables
- **Communication Channels**: Direct and broadcast messaging systems
- **Tool and Platform Requirements**: Technical infrastructure needs
- **Documentation Standards**: Recording and knowledge sharing requirements
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Continuous improvement data collection
