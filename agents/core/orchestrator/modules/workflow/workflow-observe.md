# Workflow Phase: OBSERVE - Situation Assessment

## Objective
Understand current system state and incoming requirements through comprehensive analysis of all relevant factors affecting workflow orchestration.

## Core Activities

### System State Monitoring
Comprehensive assessment of current operational status:
- **Agent Status Review**: Current availability, workload, and performance of all agents
- **Resource Assessment**: Available computational, memory, and time resources
- **Active Workflow Analysis**: Ongoing workflows and their progress status
- **Queue Management**: Pending tasks and their priority levels
- **Performance Metrics**: Current system performance indicators and trends

### Requirement Analysis
Deep understanding of incoming workflow requests:
- **Scope Definition**: Clear identification of deliverables and success criteria
- **Complexity Assessment**: Technical and coordination complexity evaluation
- **Stakeholder Identification**: All parties affected by or involved in the workflow
- **Timeline Analysis**: Deadline requirements and scheduling constraints
- **Quality Standards**: Specific requirements for accuracy, completeness, and performance

### Constraint Identification
Recognition of limitations and challenges:
- **Resource Constraints**: Limited availability of agents, time, or computational resources
- **Technical Constraints**: Platform, tool, or capability limitations
- **Process Constraints**: Organizational or methodological requirements
- **External Dependencies**: Third-party services or stakeholder availability
- **Risk Factors**: Potential issues that could impact workflow success

### Context Gathering
Comprehensive information collection:
- **Historical Data**: Previous similar workflows and their outcomes
- **Stakeholder Input**: Requirements and preferences from involved parties
- **Environmental Factors**: Current system load and external conditions
- **Knowledge Base Access**: Relevant documentation and institutional memory
- **Best Practice Review**: Proven approaches for similar scenarios
