# Workflow Phase: EXECUTE - Workflow Management

## Prerequisite: User Authorization
**MANDATORY**: This phase can ONLY begin after explicit user authorization has been obtained in the PLAN phase.

### Authorization Verification
Before beginning any execution activities, verify:
- ✅ User has reviewed the complete execution plan
- ✅ User has provided explicit permission to proceed  
- ✅ Authorization is documented in workflow log
- ✅ Emergency stop protocols are active and understood

## Objective
