- **Optimization**: Context structure improvement and access optimization

## Chat History Session Management

### Session File Creation
- **Descriptive File Names**: Generate descriptive filenames using format `chat-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH-MM}-{topic-description}.md`
- **Topic Extraction**: Automatically extract or manually specify topic from conversation content
- **File Naming Convention**: Examples: `chat-2025-06-05-14-30-authentication-discussion.md`, `chat-2025-06-05-16-45-database-migration-planning.md`
- **Automatic Session Detection**: Trigger new session creation on chat initiation
- **Session Boundaries**: Define clear start/end points for session separation
- **Metadata Headers**: Include comprehensive session metadata in each file
- **Storage Location**: All sessions stored in `docs/internal/knowledge-base/development-sessions/` directory
