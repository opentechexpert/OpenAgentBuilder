# Context Retrieval Protocol

## Purpose
Implement systematic context retrieval from the OpenAgentBuilder institutional memory system to inform coordination decisions, apply proven patterns, and maintain consistency with established architectural principles.

## Memory and Context Access

### Knowledge Base Integration
This agent has access to the OpenAgentBuilder institutional memory system:
