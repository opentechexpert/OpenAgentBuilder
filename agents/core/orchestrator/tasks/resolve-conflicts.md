- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Plan engagement with affected agents and stakeholders
- **Resource Requirements**: Identify resources needed for conflict resolution
- **Risk Mitigation**: Plan for potential negative consequences of resolution actions

### MOBILIZE Phase
- **Team Assembly**: Gather relevant agents and stakeholders for resolution
- **Information Sharing**: Ensure all parties have complete conflict context
- **Ground Rules**: Establish principles and protocols for resolution process

- **Preventive Measures**: Implement systems to prevent similar conflicts
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share conflict patterns and resolutions with team
- **Relationship Repair**: Facilitate restoration of damaged working relationships
- **System Updates**: Update workflows and processes to prevent recurrence

## Conflict Types & Approaches

### Resource Conflicts
- **Approach**: Prioritization matrix, resource reallocation, timeline adjustment
- **Tools**: Resource utilization analysis, priority scoring, capacity planning

### Priority Conflicts
- **Approach**: Stakeholder alignment, objective clarification, trade-off analysis
- **Tools**: Priority frameworks, stakeholder mapping, impact assessment

### Technical Conflicts
- **Approach**: Expert consultation, technical analysis, proof-of-concept testing
- **Tools**: Technical review, architecture analysis, prototype development

### Process Conflicts
- **Approach**: Process optimization, workflow redesign, standard definition
- **Tools**: Process mapping, efficiency analysis, best practice research

### Communication Conflicts
- **Approach**: Communication protocol definition, information flow optimization
- **Tools**: Communication audit, protocol design, feedback mechanisms

## Resolution Strategies
- **Collaboration**: Work together to find mutually beneficial solutions
- **Compromise**: Find middle ground that partially satisfies all parties
- **Authority**: Make executive decisions when collaboration fails
- **Avoidance**: Temporarily postpone resolution when timing is inappropriate
- **Competition**: Support the solution that best serves overall objectives
