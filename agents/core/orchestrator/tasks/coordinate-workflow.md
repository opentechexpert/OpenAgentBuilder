# Coordinate Workflow Task

## Purpose
Orchestrate complex multi-agent workflows by coordinating tasks, managing dependencies, and ensuring seamless collaboration between specialized agents throughout the development lifecycle.

## Task Workflow

### OBSERVE Phase
- **Workflow Analysis**: Assess current project state and active workflows
- **Agent Status Review**: Monitor all active agents and their current tasks
- **Dependency Mapping**: Identify task dependencies and critical path elements
- **Resource Assessment**: Evaluate available resources and potential bottlenecks
- **Context Gathering**: Collect relevant project context and historical data

### PLAN Phase
- **Workflow Design**: Create comprehensive workflow execution plan
- **Agent Assignment**: Assign specific tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- **Timeline Planning**: Establish realistic timelines and milestones
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- **Communication Strategy**: Plan information flow and coordination touchpoints

### MOBILIZE Phase
- **Agent Preparation**: Brief agents on their roles and responsibilities
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute resources and establish access permissions
- **Tool Setup**: Configure necessary tools and integrations
- **Communication Channels**: Establish coordination channels and protocols
- **Checkpoint Definition**: Set up monitoring and review checkpoints

### EXECUTE Phase
- **Workflow Initiation**: Launch coordinated workflow execution
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track progress and agent performance
- **Dynamic Coordination**: Adjust coordination based on real-time feedback
- **Issue Resolution**: Address conflicts and obstacles as they arise
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensure work meets established quality standards

### REVIEW Phase
- **Progress Evaluation**: Assess workflow progress against planned milestones
- **Quality Assessment**: Review deliverables for completeness and quality
- **Performance Analysis**: Analyze agent and system performance metrics
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Gather feedback from relevant stakeholders
- **Lesson Learning**: Identify improvements for future workflow coordination

### INTEGRATE Phase
- **Deliverable Integration**: Merge agent outputs into cohesive project deliverables
- **Knowledge Capture**: Document workflow patterns and best practices
- **System Updates**: Update system knowledge base with new insights
- **Continuous Improvement**: Implement improvements to coordination processes
- **Success Validation**: Confirm workflow objectives have been achieved

## Key Coordination Principles
- **Transparency**: Maintain clear visibility into all workflow activities
- **Flexibility**: Adapt coordination strategies based on real-time needs
- **Quality Focus**: Never compromise quality for speed
- **Collaboration**: Foster effective inter-agent communication
- **Efficiency**: Optimize resource utilization and minimize waste

## Success Metrics
- Workflow completion within planned timeline
- Quality standards met or exceeded
- Agent coordination effectiveness
- Resource utilization efficiency
- Stakeholder satisfaction levels

## Common Challenges
- **Conflicting Priorities**: Balance competing agent and project priorities
- **Resource Constraints**: Optimize workflow within resource limitations
- **Communication Gaps**: Ensure effective information flow between agents
- **Quality vs Speed**: Maintain quality while meeting timeline requirements
- **Scope Changes**: Adapt workflows to accommodate changing requirements
