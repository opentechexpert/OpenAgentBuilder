# PLAN â†’ EXECUTE Authorization Gate Implementation

## Overview
Detailed implementation requirements for the mandatory authorization gate between PLAN and EXECUTE phases across all OpenAgentBuilder agents.

## Authorization Gate Requirements

### Pre-Authorization Information
Before requesting permission, agents must provide:

1. **Action Summary**: Clear, specific list of what will be done
2. **Impact Assessment**: What will change and why
3. **Resource Requirements**: Time, tools, or access needed
4. **Risk Factors**: Potential issues or side effects
5. **Success Criteria**: How success will be measured

### Authorization Request Format
**Required Template:**
```markdown
## Plan Summary
Based on my analysis, I propose the following actions:

### Specific Actions:
1. [Action 1 with clear details]
2. [Action 2 with clear details]
3. [Action 3 with clear details]

### Expected Outcomes:
- [Outcome 1]
- [Outcome 2]
- [Outcome 3]

### Resource Requirements:
- [Resource 1]
- [Resource 2]

### Potential Risks:
- [Risk 1 and mitigation]
- [Risk 2 and mitigation]

## Authorization Request
May I proceed with these actions? Please choose:

- [ ] **Yes, proceed as planned** - Execute all proposed actions
- [ ] **Modify the plan** - I'll suggest specific changes
- [ ] **Partial approval** - Approve only certain actions  
- [ ] **No, do not proceed** - Stop and reassess
- [ ] **Need more information** - Provide additional details first

Please indicate your choice and any specific modifications or questions.
```

### User Response Handling
Agents must handle all possible responses:

**"Yes, proceed"**: Begin execution with progress updates
**"Modify the plan"**: Request specific changes and create revised plan
**"Partial approval"**: Execute only approved actions, pause for further instruction
**"No, do not proceed"**: Acknowledge and ask for guidance on next steps
**"Need more information"**: Provide requested details, do not proceed to execution

### Emergency Stop Protocol
- Users can type "STOP" or "HALT" at any time during execution
- Agents must check for stop commands during long-running operations
- Immediate acknowledgment and cessation of current activities required
- Status report and next steps discussion after emergency stop

## Implementation in Workflow Modules

### ASK Phase (No Change)
- Continue normal context gathering
- No authorization required for information gathering

### PLAN Phase Enhancement
**Add at end of PLAN phase:**
```markdown
## User Authorization Required
[Use authorization request template above]

**I will wait for your explicit permission before proceeding to execution.**
```

### EXECUTE Phase Protection
**Add at start of EXECUTE phase:**
```markdown
## Authorization Verification
**STOP**: This phase requires user authorization. 
If you have not explicitly approved this execution, I should not proceed.
Please confirm authorization before continuing.
```

## Quality Assurance Testing

### Required Tests
1. **Authorization Gate Test**: Verify agents pause after PLAN phase
2. **Clear Communication Test**: Verify action descriptions are specific and understandable
3. **Response Handling Test**: Verify all user response types are handled correctly
4. **Emergency Stop Test**: Verify immediate response to stop commands
5. **Modification Test**: Verify agents can adapt plans based on user feedback

### Test Scenarios
- User approves full plan
- User requests plan modifications
- User partially approves plan
- User rejects plan entirely
- User requests more information
- User issues emergency stop during execution

## Rollout Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Agents (Week 1)
- Update Orchestrator, Doc Writer, Prompt Engineer V2
- Test authorization protocols
- Validate user experience

### Phase 2: Development Agents (Week 2)  
- Update all development team agents
- Test collaborative authorization workflows
- Validate coordination protocols

### Phase 3: All Remaining Agents (Week 3)
- Update management and specialized agents
- Complete system-wide testing
- Final validation and documentation

## Success Metrics
- **Zero unauthorized executions**: No agent takes action without explicit permission
- **User satisfaction**: Clear understanding of proposed actions
- **Workflow efficiency**: Minimal disruption to productive work
- **Error reduction**: Fewer unintended consequences from agent actions

---

**Priority**: Critical System Fix
**Timeline**: 3 weeks for full implementation
**Owner**: Orchestrator Agent (coordination)
**Stakeholders**: All agent users and developers
