## Development Session Logging System

### Quick Start
1. **After completing development work**, use the standardized prompt from `/templates/development-session-logging-prompt.md`
2. **Create centralized session log** in `/docs/internal/knowledge-base/development-sessions/`
3. **Extract knowledge patterns** to `/docs/internal/knowledge-base/development-patterns/`

### Session ID Format
`{AGENT-CODE}-{SESSION-TYPE}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH}`

**Examples**:
- `PROMPT-ENG-VAL-2025-06-06-14` (Prompt Engineer Validation)
- `VSCODE-SDK-CRE-2025-06-06-15` (VS Code SDK Creation)
- `DOC-WRITER-REF-2025-06-06-16` (Doc Writer Refactor)

### Agent Codes
| Agent | Code | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| Prompt Engineer V2 | PROMPT-ENG | Agent creation and validation |
| Doc Writer | DOC-WRITER | Documentation and standards |
| Orchestrator | ORCHESTRATOR | Multi-agent coordination |
| VS Code SDK Integration | VSCODE-SDK | VS Code integration |
| Backend Engineer | BACKEND-ENG | Backend development |
| Frontend Engineer | FRONTEND-ENG | Frontend development |
| QA Engineer | QA-ENG | Quality assurance |
| Master Software Engineer | MASTER-ENG | Technical leadership |

### Session Types
- **CRE**: Creation (new components)
- **VAL**: Validation (quality assessment)
- **REF**: Refactor (structural improvements)
- **ENH**: Enhancement (feature additions)
- **ANA**: Analysis (investigation)
- **FIX**: Fix (issue resolution)
- **INT**: Integration (ecosystem work)

## Quality Standards Integration

All development sessions must follow OpenAgentBuilder quality standards:

### Required Quality Checks
- [ ] Session documented in standardized format
- [ ] Changes properly versioned and explained
- [ ] Cross-references validated and updated
- [ ] Knowledge patterns extracted and shared
- [ ] Integration impacts assessed

### Quality Metrics Tracking
- Development velocity and quality trends
- Standards compliance rates
- Cross-agent collaboration effectiveness
- Knowledge pattern reuse statistics

## Automation and Tools

### Current Tools
- **Template Generators**: Standardized session entry templates
- **Cross-Reference Validators**: Automated link checking
- **Quality Checklists**: Interactive standards validation
- **Session Statistics**: Automated metrics collection

### Future Enhancements
- **AI-Powered Pattern Recognition**: Automated insight extraction
- **Real-time Quality Scoring**: Continuous assessment
- **Cross-Agent Notifications**: Automatic collaboration alerts
- **Predictive Analytics**: Development trend analysis

## Access and Permissions

### Read Access
- All OpenAgentBuilder agents
- Project stakeholders
- Community contributors (public sections)

### Write Access
- OpenAgentBuilder agents (their own logs)
- System administrators
- Quality assurance team

### Maintenance
- **Weekly**: Review session logs for completeness
- **Monthly**: Update process documentation
- **Quarterly**: Analyze trends and improve procedures

## Integration with Agent Workflows

All agents should include development session logging in their DOCUMENT phase:

```markdown
## Development Session Logging
- **Session Documentation**: Create comprehensive session log
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Document reusable patterns
- **Cross-Agent Integration**: Update project tracking
- **Quality Validation**: Apply standards compliance
- **Institutional Memory**: Contribute to knowledge base
```
