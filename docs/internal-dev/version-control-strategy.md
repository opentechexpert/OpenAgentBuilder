# Version Control Strategy for OpenAgentBuilder

## Overview

OpenAgentBuilder follows semantic versioning (SemVer) principles adapted for early-stage open-source development. As we are in the foundational development phase, all components use 0.x versioning to indicate pre-release status.

## Versioning Standards

### Project Status: Early Development (0.x)

The entire OpenAgentBuilder project is currently in early development phase, using 0.x versioning to indicate:
- **API instability**: Agent interfaces and protocols may change
- **Feature incompleteness**: Core features are still being developed
- **Community readiness**: Not yet ready for production use
- **Rapid iteration**: Frequent changes and improvements expected

### Version Number Format

**Format**: `0.MINOR.PATCH`

- **Major**: Always 0 during early development
- **Minor**: Incremented for significant feature additions or architectural changes
- **Patch**: Incremented for bug fixes, documentation updates, and minor improvements

### Current Agent Versions (as of June 5, 2025)

| Agent | Version | Status | Description |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Prompt Engineer V2 | 0.2.0 | Active Development | Synthesis and refactoring specialist |
| Doc Writer | 0.1.0 | Active Development | Technical documentation specialist |
| Orchestrator | 0.1.0 | Active Development | Multi-agent coordination specialist |
| Development Agents | 0.0.x | Planned | Backend, Frontend, QA, System Analyst |
| Management Agents | 0.0.x | Planned | PM, PO, Scrum Master |
| Specialized Agents | 0.0.x | Future | Domain-specific agents |

## Version Progression Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (0.1.x - 0.3.x)
**Current Phase**
- Core agent development and refinement
- Repository structure establishment
- Basic documentation and standards
- Initial community preparation

### Phase 2: Expansion (0.4.x - 0.6.x)
**Target: Q3 2025**
- Complete agent library implementation
- Documentation website launch
- Community contribution framework
- Integration testing and validation

### Phase 3: Stabilization (0.7.x - 0.9.x)
**Target: Q4 2025**
- API stabilization and consistency
- Comprehensive testing and quality assurance
- Performance optimization
- Community feedback integration

### Phase 4: Release Readiness (0.10.x+)
**Target: Q1 2026**
- Feature completeness for v1.0
- Production readiness assessment
- Final API stabilization
- Release candidate preparation

## Release Criteria

### Minor Version Increments (0.x.0)
- New agent implementations
- Significant architectural changes
- Major feature additions
- Breaking changes to existing APIs

### Patch Version Increments (0.x.y)
- Bug fixes and stability improvements
- Documentation updates and clarifications
- Minor feature enhancements
- Non-breaking API improvements

## Version 1.0 Readiness Criteria

The project will move to version 1.0 when:

1. **Feature Completeness**
   - All planned core, development, and management agents implemented
   - Comprehensive documentation website operational
   - Community contribution framework established

2. **API Stability**
   - Agent interfaces stabilized and well-documented
   - Inter-agent communication protocols finalized
   - Breaking changes no longer expected

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Comprehensive testing framework implemented
   - All agents validated through real-world usage
   - Performance benchmarks established and met

4. **Community Readiness**
   - Active contributor base established
   - Clear governance and contribution guidelines
   - Support and feedback mechanisms operational

5. **Production Viability**
   - Suitable for production software development workflows
   - Reliable performance and stability demonstrated
   - Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures

## Version Control Workflow

### Development Workflow
1. **Feature Branches**: All development on feature branches
2. **Version Tagging**: Git tags for all releases (v0.x.y)
3. **Changelog Maintenance**: Detailed change logs for each release
4. **Release Notes**: Community-focused release announcements

### Agent Version Management
Each agent maintains its own version history while coordinating with overall project versioning:

```markdown
## Version History
- v0.x.y (YYYY-MM-DD): Description of changes and improvements
- v0.x.z (YYYY-MM-DD): Previous version notes
```

### Documentation Versioning
- Knowledge base documents versioned with project
- API documentation tied to specific agent versions
- Migration guides for version transitions

## Implementation Status

### Completed Actions âœ…
- Corrected development session date to June 5, 2025
- Updated all core agent versions to 0.x format
- Established version control strategy document
- Updated all file references to correct paths and versions

### Next Steps ðŸ“‹
1. Implement semantic versioning in all placeholder agents
2. Create automated version management scripts
3. Establish release workflow and tagging procedures
4. Document version upgrade and migration procedures

## Conclusion

This versioning strategy ensures OpenAgentBuilder maintains transparency about its development status while providing clear progression toward production readiness. The 0.x versioning communicates to users and contributors that the project is in active development and encourages participation in shaping its evolution toward version 1.0.
