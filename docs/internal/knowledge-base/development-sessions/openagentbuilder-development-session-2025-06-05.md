### 8. VS Code SDK Integration and Reorganization ✅

#### 8.1 SDK Structure Reorganization
**Objective**: Organize `sdk-vscode/agents/` directory to match parent `agents/` folder structure for better organization and scalability.

**Problem Identified**: 
- SDK agents were in a flat directory structure (all 11 `.prompt.md` files in single folder)
- Inconsistent with parent `agents/` organized structure (core/development/management)
- Difficult agent discovery and navigation for users
- Duplicate files found in both root and subdirectories

**Solution Implemented**:
```
// Before: Flat structure
sdk-vscode/agents/
├── [11 .prompt.md files in single directory]

// After: Organized structure
sdk-vscode/agents/
├── core/ (3 agents)
│   ├── doc-writer.prompt.md
│   ├── orchestrator.prompt.md
│   └── prompt-engineer-v2.prompt.md
├── development/ (5 agents)
│   ├── backend-engineer.prompt.md
│   ├── frontend-engineer.prompt.md
│   ├── master-software-engineer.prompt.md
│   ├── quality-assurance-engineer.prompt.md
│   └── system-analyst.prompt.md
└── management/ (3 agents)
    ├── product-owner.prompt.md
    ├── project-manager.prompt.md
    └── scrum-master.prompt.md
```
