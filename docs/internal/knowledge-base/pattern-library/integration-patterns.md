### Pattern 4: TDD-Integrated Development Workflow
**Context**: Implementing test-driven development across all agent workflows

**Participants**:
- Development Team Agents (Implementation)
- Quality Assurance Engineer (Testing Strategy)
- Orchestrator Agent (Workflow Coordination)
- Prompt Engineer V2 (Agent Quality)

**Workflow Pattern**:
1. **Test Strategy Definition**: QA Engineer defines comprehensive testing approach
2. **Test-First Implementation**: Development agents implement test-first development
3. **Continuous Quality Gates**: Regular validation and quality checkpoints
4. **Integration Testing**: Cross-agent testing and validation
5. **Quality Optimization**: Continuous improvement of quality processes

**Success Metrics**:
- 100% TDD compliance across all development workflows
- 95%+ test coverage for all implemented functionality
- Reduced defect rates through test-first development
- Improved development velocity through quality integration

**Lessons Learned**:
- TDD integration improves overall development quality significantly
- Quality-first mindset enhances all aspects of development, not just code
- Continuous quality gates prevent quality debt accumulation
- Collaborative quality responsibility improves team effectiveness

## Integration Best Practices

### Communication Protocols
