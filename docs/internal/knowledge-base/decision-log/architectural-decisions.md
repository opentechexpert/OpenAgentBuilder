## Major Architectural Decisions

### AD-001: Test-Driven Development as Core Principle
**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Status**: Decided  
**Decision Maker**: OpenAgentBuilder Core Team  

**Context**: Need to establish core development philosophy for OpenAgentBuilder ecosystem.

**Decision**: Test-driven development (TDD) will be a core principle integrated throughout all OpenAgentBuilder agents and workflows.

**Rationale**:
- **Quality First**: TDD ensures quality is built into the development process from the beginning
- **Community Confidence**: High-quality, well-tested agents increase community adoption and trust
- **Collaborative Development**: TDD principles support effective team collaboration and contribution
- **Sustainable Growth**: Quality-first approach enables sustainable scaling of the ecosystem
- **Innovation Support**: Strong quality foundation enables innovation without compromising reliability

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Quality as Add-On**: Traditional development with quality assurance at the end
   - Rejected: Leads to quality debt and downstream issues
2. **Partial TDD**: TDD for some components but not others
   - Rejected: Inconsistent quality standards and community confusion
3. **Community Choice**: Let community decide on quality approaches
   - Rejected: Lack of standardization would harm ecosystem coherence

**Implementation**:
- Quality Assurance Engineer integrated into Development Team Agents
- All agent workflows include quality gates and validation checkpoints
- Documentation follows test-driven principles with validation requirements
- Community contribution guidelines emphasize quality and testing

**Success Criteria**:
- 95%+ test coverage across all agent implementations
- Reduced defect rates compared to traditional development approaches
- Community adoption of TDD principles in contributions
- Measurable improvement in development velocity through quality integration

### AD-002: Agent Categorization Structure
**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Status**: Decided  
**Decision Maker**: OpenAgentBuilder Core Team  

**Context**: Need to organize agents in a logical, scalable structure that supports collaboration and growth.

**Decision**: Organize agents into four primary categories: Core, Development Team, Management, and Specialized.

**Rationale**:
- **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each category has distinct responsibilities and capabilities
- **TDD Integration**: Development Team category enables integrated quality and testing workflows
- **Scalability**: Structure supports growth from foundational agents to comprehensive ecosystem
- **Community Understanding**: Clear categorization helps community understand agent purposes and relationships
- **Workflow Optimization**: Categorization enables efficient workflow design and agent coordination

**Categories Defined**:
1. **Core Agents**: Essential system functionality (Prompt Engineer V2, Doc Writer, Orchestrator)
2. **Development Team Agents**: TDD-integrated development workflows with Quality Assurance Engineer
3. **Management Agents**: Project coordination and stakeholder management
4. **Specialized Agents**: Infrastructure, security, and domain-specific capabilities

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Flat Structure**: All agents at same organizational level
   - Rejected: Would become unwieldy as ecosystem grows
2. **Functional Grouping**: Organization by technical function (frontend, backend, etc.)
   - Rejected: Doesn't support integrated TDD workflows effectively
3. **Complexity-Based**: Organization by agent complexity or sophistication
   - Rejected: Complexity is subjective and changes over time

**Implementation**:
- Repository structure organized by agent categories
- Documentation structure reflects categorization
- Workflow design considers category relationships and collaboration patterns
- Community guidelines explain category purposes and agent selection

### AD-003: Six-Phase Workflow Methodology
**Date**: December 19, 2024  
**Status**: Decided  
**Decision Maker**: OpenAgentBuilder Core Team  

**Context**: Need standardized workflow methodology that ensures consistency, quality, and effectiveness across all agents.

**Decision**: Implement six-phase workflow methodology as universal pattern for all OpenAgentBuilder agents.

**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: Standardized approach enables predictable and reliable outcomes
- **Quality Integration**: Built-in phases for validation, testing, and continuous improvement
- **Community Learning**: Consistent patterns reduce learning curve for community contributors
- **Workflow Coordination**: Standardized phases enable effective multi-agent orchestration
- **Continuous Improvement**: Built-in feedback and optimization cycles

**Six-Phase Pattern**:
1. **Phase 1**: Requirements gathering and analysis
2. **Phase 2**: Strategic planning and design
3. **Phase 3**: Development and implementation
4. **Phase 4**: Quality assurance and validation
5. **Phase 5**: Deployment and integration
6. **Phase 6**: Monitoring and continuous improvement

**Agent-Specific Implementations**:
- **Prompt Engineer V2**: ASK → ANALYZE → DESIGN → DEVELOP → TEST → REFINE
- **Doc Writer**: ASK → PLAN → DEVELOP → REVIEW → DEPLOY → VALIDATE
- **Orchestrator**: OBSERVE → PLAN → MOBILIZE → EXECUTE → REVIEW → INTEGRATE

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Three-Phase**: Simplified approach with fewer phases
   - Rejected: Insufficient granularity for quality assurance and optimization
2. **Agent-Specific**: Each agent defines its own workflow methodology
   - Rejected: Inconsistency would harm ecosystem coherence and coordination
3. **Industry Standard**: Adopt existing methodology (e.g., Agile, Waterfall)
   - Rejected: Existing methodologies not optimized for AI agent workflows

**Implementation**:
- All new agents implement six-phase pattern with agent-specific naming
- Existing agents updated to align with six-phase structure
- Documentation templates include six-phase workflow section
- Orchestrator Agent designed to coordinate six-phase workflows effectively
