# OpenAgentBuilder

> **An open-source library of AI agents for collaborative software development**

OpenAgentBuilder is a comprehensive platform that transforms the way teams build software by providing a standardized library of AI agents designed for collaborative development workflows with test-driven development (TDD) principles. Built on proven software factory methodologies, OpenAgentBuilder enables teams to deploy sophisticated AI agent ecosystems that follow structured workflows, prioritize quality and testing, and produce consistent, high-quality outputs.

- **🧪 Test-Driven Development**: TDD principles integrated throughout all agent workflows and collaboration patterns
- **🔧 Specialized Agent Library**: Comprehensive collection of agents for every aspect of software development
- **🤝 Collaborative Design**: Agents designed to work together effectively in software factory teams with quality-first approaches
- **📚 Legacy Integration**: Systematic transformation of existing methodologies into standardized formats
- **🌍 Open Source**: Community-driven development with transparent contribution processes
- **📖 Comprehensive Documentation**: Extensive guides, tutorials, and best practices delivered through a modern Astro Starlight website

## 🎯 Current Status

**Phase 1: Foundation Establishment (85% Complete)**

✅ **Core Agent Foundation** - All three foundational agents completed
- **Orchestrator Agent** - Multi-agent coordination and workflow management
- **Prompt Engineer Agent V2** - Agent development and optimization specialist  
- **Doc Writer Agent** - Technical documentation and content architecture

✅ **Directory Structure** - Clean, scalable organization implemented
✅ **VS Code Integration** - Complete platform integration ready
✅ **TDD Integration** - Test-driven development principles integrated
🚧 **Documentation Website** - Astro Starlight infrastructure ready for deployment  

## 🏛️ Architecture

OpenAgentBuilder agents are built using a standardized template structure that ensures consistency and interoperability:

```markdown
# Agent Name

## Agent Identity
- Role, version, and creation metadata

## Purpose Statement
- Clear, concise mission statement

## Context
- Ecosystem position and relationships

## Core Capabilities
- Key functional abilities

## Workflow (Six Phases)
1. ASK - Gather requirements
2. PLAN - Develop approach
3. EXECUTE - Implement solution
4. DEBUG - Identify and fix issues
5. REVIEW - Evaluate effectiveness
6. DOCUMENT - Create comprehensive documentation

## Communication Protocols
- Inter-agent interaction standards

## Performance Metrics
- Measurable success criteria
```
