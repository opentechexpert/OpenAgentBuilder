# Standard Development Session Logging Prompt

## Copy-Paste Template for All Agents

When any agent completes development work, use this standardized prompt:

```
## ðŸ“‹ Development Session Logging Request

Following OpenAgentBuilder development session logging protocol, please:

### 1. Create Session Documentation
**Session ID**: {AGENT-CODE}-{SESSION-TYPE}-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{HH}
**Location**: `/docs/internal/knowledge-base/development-sessions/`

**Required Sections**:
- Session metadata (conductor, type, duration, status)
- Methodology applied (workflow phases, standards used)
- Changes made (files, versions, configurations)
- Key findings (discoveries, assessments, validations)
- Recommendations (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- Next steps (action items, dependencies, timeline)

### 2. Extract Knowledge Patterns
**Location**: `/docs/internal/knowledge-base/development-patterns/`
- Document any reusable patterns discovered
- Update existing pattern libraries
- Create new pattern files if significant methodologies emerged

### 3. Version Management
- Update agent version if significant changes occurred
- Document version increment rationale
- Ensure consistency across all references

### 4. Quality Validation
- Apply relevant OpenAgentBuilder quality checklists
- Document compliance status and scores
- Note any standards improvements identified

**Reference**: [Development Session Logging Protocol](../docs/internal/development-session-logging-protocol.md)

## Implementation Guidance

### For Agent Developers
1. **Copy the template** appropriate for your session type
2. **Fill in the specifics** (agent code, session type, date/time)
3. **Customize the requirements** based on what actually happened
4. **Submit the prompt** to trigger proper documentation

### For Quality Assurance
- Verify all agents are using standardized logging
- Review development logs for completeness
- Monitor compliance with documentation standards
- Identify process improvement opportunities

### For Project Management
- Use development session logs for progress tracking
- Monitor cross-agent collaboration patterns
- Identify resource allocation needs
- Track quality trends across the ecosystem
