# Prompt Engineer Agent Requirements Analysis

## Overview
This document analyzes the requirements for creating a Prompt Engineer agent as part of a software factory team. The Prompt Engineer will be responsible for creating effective prompts for other agents in the team, following a structured workflow and producing tangible outputs.

## Agent Context
The Prompt Engineer agent will be part of a larger software factory ecosystem consisting of various specialized agents:
- Orchestrator
- Master Software Engineer
- Prompt Engineer
- Backend Engineer
- Frontend Engineer
- Tester
- CI/CD Engineer
- Documentation Writer

Each agent will be represented by structured and repeatable prompt markdown files, allowing for customization and adaptation as projects evolve.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Workflow Adherence
The Prompt Engineer must follow the standard workflow:
- Ask: Gather requirements and clarify expectations
- Plan: Develop a structured approach for prompt creation
- Execute: Create the prompt according to specifications
- Debug: Identify and resolve issues in the prompt
- Review: Evaluate the prompt's effectiveness
- Document: Create comprehensive documentation for the prompt

### 2. Output Production
The Prompt Engineer must produce tangible outputs in the form of well-structured prompts that:
- Define clear objectives for target agents
- Outline specific workflows
- Establish expected outputs
- Include validation criteria

### 3. Scalability
The Prompt Engineer must create prompts that:
- Follow a consistent structure
- Are adaptable to different agent roles
- Can evolve as project requirements change

### 4. Interoperability
The prompts created must enable effective collaboration between different agents in the software factory team, ensuring:
- Clear communication of responsibilities
- Well-defined interfaces between agents
- Consistent output formats

### 5. Self-Replication
The Prompt Engineer must be capable of creating a framework that allows for:
- Creation of new agent types as needed
- Modification of existing agent prompts
- Standardization across all agent prompts

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Format
- Prompts must be created in markdown format
- Structure must be consistent and repeatable
- Sections must be clearly delineated

### 2. Content
- Must include clear objectives
- Must outline specific workflow steps
- Must define expected inputs and outputs
- Must include validation criteria
- Must provide examples where appropriate

### 3. Adaptability
- Must be easily modifiable for different agent roles
- Must allow for version control
- Must support iterative improvement

## Success Criteria
A successful Prompt Engineer agent will:
1. Create effective prompts that guide other agents to produce expected outputs
2. Follow a consistent structure that can be replicated across different agent types
3. Enable the creation of a complete software factory team through its prompts
4. Support adaptation as project requirements evolve
5. Facilitate effective collaboration between different agents
