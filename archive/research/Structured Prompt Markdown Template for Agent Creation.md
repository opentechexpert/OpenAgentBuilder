## Template Usage Guidelines

### Customization Instructions
1. Replace all bracketed text with specific content for the target agent
2. Add or remove sections as appropriate for the specific agent role
3. Ensure all workflow phases are included and tailored to the agent's responsibilities
4. Maintain consistent formatting and structure across all agent prompts

### Required Sections
The following sections must be included in all agent prompts:
- Agent Identity
- Purpose Statement
- Workflow (with all six phases)
- Input Specifications
- Output Specifications
- Performance Metrics

### Optional Sections
The following sections may be included or excluded based on the specific agent role:
- Context
- Communication Protocols
- Error Handling
- Continuous Improvement
- Version History
- References

### Adaptation Guidelines
When adapting this template for different agent roles:
1. Focus on the specific responsibilities and outputs of the target agent
2. Tailor the workflow phases to emphasize the most critical aspects for that agent
3. Adjust the level of detail based on the complexity of the agent's role
4. Ensure consistency in terminology across all agent prompts
5. Maintain the overall structure for interoperability between agents

### Version Control
When updating an agent prompt:
1. Increment the version number according to semantic versioning principles
2. Document changes in the Version History section
3. Update the Last Updated date
4. Ensure backward compatibility or provide migration guidance
