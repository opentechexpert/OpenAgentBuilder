## Critical Template Design Principles

### BMAD System Alignment
- **Pattern Consistency:** All templates must follow established BMAD structural patterns
- **Integration Ready:** Templates should generate components that integrate seamlessly
- **Configuration Compatible:** All outputs must work with existing orchestrator setup
- **Maintenance Friendly:** Templates should be easy to update and extend

### Usability Standards
- **Clear Instructions:** Every placeholder and section must have clear usage guidance
- **Progressive Complexity:** Templates should work for both simple and complex use cases
- **Error Prevention:** Design should minimize common mistakes and omissions
- **Validation Support:** Include checkpoints and validation criteria throughout

### Flexibility & Standardization Balance
- **Core Consistency:** Maintain essential structural elements across all instances
- **Customization Hooks:** Provide clear points for domain-specific adaptation
- **Scalability Support:** Templates should work for different complexity levels
- **Evolution Ready:** Design for easy template updates and pattern improvements

## Output Deliverables
